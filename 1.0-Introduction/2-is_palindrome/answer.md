Let's go through the `is_palindrome` function line by line:

```rust
fn is_palindrome(input: &str) -> bool {
```
- `fn is_palindrome(input: &str) -> bool {`: This line defines a function named `is_palindrome` that takes a string slice (`&str`) as input and returns a boolean (`bool`).
- `input: &str`: This is the parameter declaration. It indicates that the function takes a reference to a string (`&str`) as input.
- `-> bool`: This specifies that the function returns a boolean value.

```rust
    let cleaned_input = input.to_lowercase().chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect::<String>();
```
- `let cleaned_input = ...`: This line declares a variable `cleaned_input` and assigns it the result of a series of method calls.
- `input.to_lowercase()`: This method converts the input string to lowercase. This helps ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.
- `.chars()`: This method converts the string into an iterator over its characters.
- `.filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric())`: This method filters out non-alphanumeric characters. It retains only characters that are alphabetic or numeric.
- `.collect::<String>()`: This collects the filtered characters into a new `String`.

```rust
    cleaned_input == cleaned_input.chars().rev().collect::<String>()
```
- `cleaned_input == ...`: This line compares the cleaned input string with another string.
- `cleaned_input.chars()`: This method converts the cleaned input string into an iterator over its characters.
- `.rev()`: This method reverses the order of the characters in the iterator.
- `.collect::<String>()`: This collects the reversed characters into a new `String`.
- This comparison checks if the cleaned input string is equal to its reverse, determining whether it's a palindrome.
- The result of this comparison is returned from the function as the final expression.

```rust
}
```
- `}`: This closing brace marks the end of the `is_palindrome` function definition.

In summary, this function cleans the input string by converting it to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters. It then checks if the cleaned input string is equal to its reverse, determining if it's a palindrome. The function returns `true` if it's a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
