Certainly! Here's an example of a simple "FooBar" interview question:

**Question:**

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function called `foobar` that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Bar". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FooBar".

**Example:**
```rust
fn main() {
    foobar(15);
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
2
Foo
4
Bar
Foo
7
8
Foo
Bar
11
Foo
13
14
FooBar
```

This is a simple example of a "FooBar" interview question that tests the candidate's understanding of basic control flow and conditional logic. It's often used to gauge problem-solving skills and familiarity with programming concepts.
