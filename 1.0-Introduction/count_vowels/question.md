**Question:**

Write a Rust function called `count_vowels` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity, meaning both uppercase and lowercase vowels should be counted.

**Example:**
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", count_vowels("Hello World")); // Should print: 3
    println!("{}", count_vowels("Rust is Fun")); // Should print: 2
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
2
```
