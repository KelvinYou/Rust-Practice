Let's break down the implementation of the `count_vowels` function line by line:

```rust
fn count_vowels(input: &str) -> usize {
```
- `fn count_vowels(input: &str) -> usize {`: This line defines a function named `count_vowels` that takes a string slice (`&str`) as input and returns a `usize`, which represents the count of vowels in the string.
- `input: &str`: This is the parameter declaration. It indicates that the function takes a reference to a string (`&str`) as input.
- `-> usize`: This specifies that the function returns a `usize`.

```rust
    let vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
```
- `let vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";`: This line declares a variable `vowels` and assigns it a string containing all lowercase and uppercase vowels.

```rust
    input.chars().filter(|c| vowels.contains(*c)).count()
```
- `input.chars()`: This method converts the input string into an iterator over its characters.
- `.filter(|c| vowels.contains(*c))`: This method filters the characters, retaining only those characters that are present in the `vowels` string.
  - `|c| vowels.contains(*c)`: This is a closure that takes a character `c` and checks if it's present in the `vowels` string.
  - `*c` is used to dereference the character `c` because `contains` expects a `char`.
- `.count()`: This method counts the number of characters remaining after filtering, giving us the count of vowels in the string.

```rust
}
```
- `}`: This closing brace marks the end of the `count_vowels` function definition.

In summary, this function iterates over each character in the input string, filters out the characters that are vowels (both lowercase and uppercase), and counts the remaining characters to determine the number of vowels in the string.
