**Question:**

Write a Rust function called `reverse_words` that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the order of the words is reversed. Words are delimited by spaces. You can assume that the input string contains only alphabetic characters and spaces.

**Example:**
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", reverse_words("hello world")); // Should print: "world hello"
    println!("{}", reverse_words("rust is fun")); // Should print: "fun is rust"
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
world hello
fun is rust
```
