Let's break down the implementation line by line:

```rust
fn reverse_words(input: &str) -> String {
```
- `fn reverse_words(input: &str) -> String {`: This line defines a function named `reverse_words` that takes a string slice (`&str`) as input and returns a `String`.
- `input: &str`: This is the parameter declaration. It indicates that the function takes a reference to a string (`&str`) as input.
- `-> String`: This specifies that the function returns a `String`.

```rust
    let mut words: Vec<&str> = input.split_whitespace().collect();
```
- `let mut words: Vec<&str> = ...`: This line declares a mutable variable `words` of type `Vec<&str>`. This vector will hold references to the individual words in the input string.
- `input.split_whitespace()`: This method splits the input string into substrings based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).
- `collect()`: This method collects the substrings into a collection. In this case, it collects them into a `Vec<&str>`, which is a vector of string slices.

```rust
    words.reverse();
```
- `words.reverse()`: This line reverses the order of elements in the `words` vector. After this line, the last word becomes the first, the second-to-last word becomes the second, and so on.

```rust
    words.join(" ")
```
- `words.join(" ")`: This line joins the elements of the `words` vector into a single string. The elements are separated by the specified separator, which is a space `" "` in this case.

```rust
}
```
- `}`: This closing brace marks the end of the `reverse_words` function definition.

In summary, this function splits the input string into words, reverses the order of the words, and then joins them back together into a single string with spaces between them.
